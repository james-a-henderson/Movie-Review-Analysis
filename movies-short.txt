review/summary: "There Is So Much Darkness Now ~ Come For The Miracle"
review/text: Synopsis: On the daily trek from Juarez, Mexico to El Paso, Texas an ever increasing number of female workers are found raped and murdered in the surrounding desert. Investigative reporter Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) arrives from Los Angeles to pursue the story and angers both the local police and the factory owners who employee the undocumented aliens with her pointed questions and relentless quest for the truth.<br /><br />Her story goes nationwide when a young girl named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talancon) survives a vicious attack and walks out of the desert crediting the Blessed Virgin for her rescue. Her story is further enhanced when the "Wounds of Christ" (stigmata) appear in her palms. She also claims to have received a message of hope for the Virgin Mary and soon a fanatical movement forms around her to fight against the evil that holds such a stranglehold on the area.<br /><br />Critique: Possessing a lifelong fascination with such esoteric matters as Catholic mysticism, miracles and the mysterious appearance of the stigmata, I was immediately attracted to the '05 DVD release `Virgin of Juarez'. The film offers a rather unique storyline blending current socio-political concerns, the constant flow of Mexican migrant workers back and forth across the U.S./Mexican border and the traditional Catholic beliefs of the Hispanic population. I must say I was quite surprised by the unexpected route taken by the plot and the means and methods by which the heavenly message unfolds.<br /><br />`Virgin of Juarez' is not a film that you would care to watch over and over again, but it was interesting enough to merit at least one viewing. Minnie Driver delivers a solid performance and Ana Claudia Talancon is perfect as the fragile and innocent visionary Mariela. Also starring Esai Morales and Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart).

review/summary: Worthwhile and Important Story Hampered by Poor Script and Production
review/text: THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of Juarez, Mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring El Paso, Texas.  The story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light, but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and director.<br /><br />Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) is a journalist for a Los Angeles newspaper who has flown to Juarez to investigate the multiple (in the hundreds) killings of young women. The targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the US sponsored sweatshops in Juarez who are picked up at night after work, raped, beaten and killed.  Danes is convinced the Juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies, in part due to her own past issues of being too idle with similar crimes in the US.  She meets Father Herrera (Esai Morales) and a community activist Patrick (Angus MacFadyen) and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder, discovering along the way a survivor named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talanc&oacute;n), a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the Virgin Mary.  A father of one of the victims, Isidro (Jorge Cervera, Jr.) nurtures Mariela and helps her to escape the hospital, placing her in a 'church' where she becomes a 'saint' to the people of Juarez who long for the crimes to end.  Mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims' families.  Danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators, taking a sheet of photos of 'most wanted men' from the police office of Detective Lauro (Jacob Vargas), and works with the police and Father Herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in Juarez. Fearing for Mariela's life, they transport her to Los Angeles where mysterious events end the story.<br /><br />The squeaky, mawkish script was written by Michael Fallon and directed by Kevin James Dobson.  Had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism, the story would possibly have been better related.  There are some good performances by Driver, Talanc&oacute;n, Morales, and Vargas but the minor roles vary in quality.  Reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema.  It is sad when script and the production dull the impact.  Grady Harp, June 07

review/summary: This movie needed to be made.
review/text: The scenes in this film can be very disquieting due to their graphic re-enactment of real events, but this story needs to be told. I will say the violence was injected into the movie with as much taste as manageable when dealing with rape scenes, etc. Inspired by true events, women are being murdered in Juarez after they leave the factory where they work. A fearful community is suddenly given some hope when one of the young victims not only lives, but experiences 'stigmata' after seeing the Virgin Mary.  I was shocked to learn that murders in Juarez are still happening and many are unsolved. I believe this director brought a very important story to the surface. Though it's never pleasant to think about young women being murdered, this movie depicts a harsh reality of the high cost of exploited-cheap labor.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

review/summary: distantly based on a real tragedy
review/text: THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ (2006)<br />directed by Kevin James Dobson<br />approx. 1 hour 25 minutes<br /><br />The town of Juarez, Chihuahua in Mexico is just across the border from El Paso, Texas.  It is home to several factories owned by American companies who employ Mexicans at very low wages.  Since the early 1990s, Juarez has also been the murder site of hundreds of women.  There is a lot of debate as to whether the deaths are the work of a drug gang or a serial killer.  It has also been suggested that due to the local police department's failure to solve the crimes, new rapists and thugs have moved to the area knowing that they will never be caught.  The situation is an overwhelming tragedy and this movie uses the story as a backdrop.<br /><br />We start off seeing how unsafe women feel as they walk and work in Juarez.  Then we meet the hard-headed American journalist played by Minnie Driver.  She aggressively questions the local police and befriends a Catholic priest.  Within the first twenty minutes or so, we see the terrifying reality of the situation in Juarez.<br /><br />At this point, the story jumps from something that might have happened to something that is only found in this movie.  A woman named Mariela survives an brutal attack but is in critical condition in a small hospital.  While the priest is speaking to her, she lets out a howl... and her hands begin bleeding*.  This "stigmata" is meant to show that she has been blessed by the Virgin Mary.  Our reporter protagonist clashes with various authorities on what should be done.  Meanwhile Mariela goes underground and attracts a devoted following, eventually landing her own radio show (!) and living under the protection of gang members, whom she refers to as "modern warriors".  The only thing missing is "Jes&uacute;s Malverde".<br /><br />Now I understand that we don't know everything about the Juarez murders and that a screenwriter has to "fill in the blanks" when crafting an exciting dramatization.  However if you are going to deviate so far from the true story, then don't preface your movie as being "based on the ongoing unsolved murders in Cuidad Juarez".  There is plenty of interesting and legitimate information in the REAL stories of Juarez and there is no need to fabricate.  This movie may "raise the issue" of the Juarez women, but it isn't really about them at all!<br /><br />If you are interested in learning more about the killings in Juarez, there are a few documentaries.  A recent one from Las Perlas Del Mar Films is simply titled 'JUAREZ' and is a good introduction.  Zulma Aguiar's 'JUAREZ MOTHERS FIGHT FEMICIDE' (focuses on the families) is also easy to find.  There is another one which I haven't seen titled 'BORDER ECHOES'.<br /><br />*- note to Hollywood:<br />the nails that crucified Jesus were through his wrists, not his palms!

review/summary: "What's going on down in Juarez and shining a light on it"
review/text: Informationally, this SHOWTIME original is essential viewing for enlightening audiences on the dangerous plight of women migrant workers from Los Angeles who are routinely and mysteriously murdered on the border between Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas.Since 1993, hundreds of woman have turned up dead and mutilated and no one seems to either care or have an answer. The fear and death continue.<br /><br />Director Kevin Dobson has brought us Michael Fallon's screenplay THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ to the screen as a fanciful/possible solution to what may be happening down in Juarez.Though this is but a film, the information about the unsolved murders and the religious fanaticism in the area is crucial.<br /><br />Suggested companion film would be AGNES OF GOD.

review/summary: A  Rock N Roll History Lesson
review/text: Over the past few years, public television has put on a series of vintage &quot;Doo Wop&quot;  and Rock 'N' Roll concert reunions that have been absolutely flawless.  This latest dvd &quot;Rock, Rhythm And &quot;Doo Wop&quot;, is a total delight to ones ears.  Keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era, when vocal talent was essential, to get a recording contract?  They did not have modern day computerized overdub technology, which enables many modern day artist's with limited ability to survive?  This dvd reads like a who's who of early rock.  The architect of rock, Little Richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of &quot;Keep-A Rockin&quot;, and the line-up that follows, keeps this concert at a premium level of performances.  You get to see and hear Lou Christie, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Joey Dee and the Starliters, Frankie Valli, Fred Paris and the Satins and the Countours, just to name a few.  However, nothing prepared me for the performance of Jay Black and the Americans?  After singing &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, Jay gave a performance, that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again.  As he prepared to sing &quot;Cara Mia&quot;, he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25, and must now at age 62, hit those same notes?  Hit those notes he did!  Using that opera trained voice, he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on it's feet, showering him with a well deserved standing ovation.  If you are a fan of the old-time vocal and rock sound of the 50's and 60's, this is an absolute must have dvd.  I highly recommend this to everyone, who enjoys those golden oldies.

review/summary: A  MUST-HAVE  video if you grew up in the 50's or 60's
review/text: I recvd this video (DVD version) as a Christmas gift.  I put it on about 11 pm just to see what it was like, and finally got dragged to bed about 4:30 in the morning.  It's the best "Oldies" video I've ever seen.  It was recorded LAST YEAR by the original singers - now mostly in their 60's, and they're still great - Jay and the Americans, Lou Christie, The Five Satins, Little Richard, Kathy Young, Little Anthony, The Fleetwoods, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Frankie Valli and about 10 other acts.  These guys sing for sheer pride and the love of singing, and it all shows.  It's a concert for PBS patrons filmed in Pittsburgh, PA, and distributed around the country to donors.  They mention that this was the third concert, and I want ALL of them.  Although the Amazon notes say this is a black and white video it is actually in color and very well produced.  The producer in fact is just a kid -only about 30 years old - but treats all of these acts with the greatest of respect, and truly celebrates their works. The DVD also has about an hour of excellent interviews.

review/summary: I expected more.
review/text: I have the Doo Wop 50 and 51 DVDs, and was anxiously waiting for Rock, Rhythm and Doo Wop to arrive. From the first video, which featured the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the 50s groups, to Doo Wop 51, it was clear that there was a giant leap forward in terms of production. Better lighting, better stage layout, and better sound quality.<br />Sadly, in terms of editing, they went overboard this time. Excessive use of pre-recorded clapping and cheering really irritated me. There are times where you can hardly hear the singing, because the pre-recorded cheering was so loud. Imagine 5 stadiums hosting the Super Bowl all crammed into one theater. It's simply too artificial. We want not only the authentic groups, but also the authentic reaction from who was there. And believe me, we don't need any extra cheering to get more goosebumps from watching these wonderful groups.<br />For whoever edited the show, I would also be careful with too much filming of the spectators during the songs and make sure to look back at Doo Wop 51 for better camera angles of the groups.<br />Is this DVD worth buying? Definately, because groups/singers Fred Parris &amp; The Satins, Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials, Little Richard, The Limelites, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Bobby Lewis, and the absolutely fantastic Contours make it all worthwhile.<br />I hope TJ Lubinsky keeps on making shows like this, they're a wonderful experience for all ages.

review/summary: Another outstanding performance and concert.
review/text: As I stated in my reviews for Doo Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51, both they and this show are extremely outstanding in nearly every way.  Frankly, I thought Little Richard's appearance was a little pointless, and while I enjoyed Frankie Ford's Sea Cruise, both of these performances seemed a little out of place on this show.  It seemed like Lou Christie was straining to hit the high notes at times, but hit them he did. I was especially impressed with Little Anthony and the Imperials acappella performance of "Two Kinds of People in the World", and Jay Black and the Americans' performance of Cara Mia (at the very respectable age of 62) is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up every time you watch it.  I wonder why the back up group Pure Gold, which appears on all three shows, doesn't get a performance of their own, because they are good.  This is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD library.  Some notes here:  all three of these shows have behind the scenes interviews with various performers.  There are five or six on Doo Wop 50, ten on Doo Wop 51, and ten or twelve on this one, but this is the only one of the three to have bonus tracks of performances, of which there are four.  There is a listing of the tracks on the back of the DVD case, but whoever designed that put them in random order, not as they appear on the DVD.  The performance listing as it appears on the DVD is as follows:<br /><br />Keep A Knocking - Little Richard<br />Sea Cruise - Frankie Ford<br />A Thousand Stars - Kathy Young and the Innocents<br />Silhouettes - The Rays<br />Do You Love Me - Contours<br />Have You Heard and You Belong to Me - Duprees<br />Peppermint Twist - Joey Dee and the Starlighters<br />For Your Love - Ed Townsend<br />Romeo and Juliet - Reflections<br />Lightning Strikes - Lou Christie<br />Tears on My Pillow, Shimmy Shimmy Ko Ko Bop, Two Kins of People in the World, Hurt So Bad, and Going Out of My Head - Little Anthony & the Imperials<br />Since I Fell for You - Lenny Welch<br />Tossing and Turning - Bobby Lewis<br />Mr. Blue and Come Softly to Me - Fleetwoods<br />Remember Then and I Believe - Larry Chance and the Earls<br />Daddy's Home - Shep and the Limelighters<br />This Magic Moment and Cara Mia - Jay Black and the Americans<br />He Don't Love You (Like I Love You) - Jerry Butler and Pure Gold<br />Stagger Lee - Lloyd Price<br />Once in a While -  Chimes<br />Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye - Casinos<br />To the Aisle and In the Still of the Night - Fred Parris and the Satins<br />Let's Hang On - Frankie Valli and cast (end credits)<br />Bonus tracks (can be viewed in any order):<br />Never - Earls<br />My Own True Love -  Duprees<br />Come a Little Bit Closer - Jay Black and the Americans<br />First I Look at the Purse - Contours.

review/summary: Outstanding Whether It Is Either On VHS Or DVD
review/text: I own both the VHS and DVD versions of this program, and I second everything the other reviewer wrote.  I used most of these songs in my after school music class with 5th and 6th graders and they love it.  We first sang the songs off lyric sheets and from CD's and then watched the DVD.  They enjoyed it so much I ordered a DVD copy for each of my students as a present for joining the class.  I would suggest ordering the DVD version since it has about eight interviews with artists from the program in addition to six extra songs that aren't available on the VHS version.  The DVD version is now available only from PBS.  The singers may be older than when they first made these songs hits, but they can still sing them as well as ever.  My only complaint with it is it has five songs by Little Anthony and the Imperials.  Two would have been enough with maybe a second song from some of the other singers in their place.  Nevertheless, you can't go wrong with either the VHS or DVD version.  I prefer the DVD since it includes extra songs and interviews that the VHS version doesn't have.

review/summary: Spectacular and suspenseful family film!
review/text: The cover of our DVD of "Far From Home" says in large letters: "Family Feature".  And a great family movie it is.  But don't make the mistake of thinking that this is just another dog movie, in this case the adventures of a Labrador named "Yellow".  Even more it is about the adventures of his young master Angus.  Angus acquires Yellow when the dog appears on the family property, apparently lost, and soon the boy and his dog become firm friends.  When Angus and Yellow are marooned in wilderness country after the sinking of his father's ship, it is their combined strength that is required to survive the rugged coastline, vast forests, and hostile wildlife.<br /><br />Most of the conflict revolves around this very real struggle against the elements, leading up to a suspenseful and heartwarming conclusion.  But along with this suspense comes excellent and convincing characterization.  More than just an adventure story, "Far From Home" is ultimately a coming-of-age story, as Angus learns about responsibility and survival.  In the process, his relationships with his father and with his dog are especially well-portrayed.<br /><br />Although the movie is "clean", I would not recommend this movie for younger children under 10 mainly because of its capacity to evoke strong emotions of fear (there are some scary moments involving a sinking ship during a storm, a wolf attack, and a perilous log crossing over a ravine) and grief (it's hard to hold back the emotions experienced at losing a missing child).  But with this depth of emotion, older children and adults alike will find it a real tear-jerker.  When combined with good acting and some lovely cinematography of beautiful rugged British Columbia, this movie is definitely a drama worth keeping for the family. - GODLY GADFLY

Angus's and Yellow's fight through the  wilderness is not glossed over or &quot;Disneyfied.&quot; The  cinematography is beautiful.

The boy and the dog become very close and forge a bond that is put to the test when they are lost in boat accident and end up stranded on a remote island. The dog stays by the young boy's side as they struggle to survive, find food, and battle a pack of wolves. All this happens while his parents and the coast guard desperately search for him.<br /><br /> After many weeks pass the Coast Guard believes they may never be found, but the dog and the boy do survive as they gain strength through each others love and devotion. It has an unusual ending, which I don't want to spoil, but Yellow Dog is one movie, although simple in structure, that really captures the true relationship that a boy and a dog can have that transcends even human friendships.

review/text: You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this film.  This is one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can enjoy.  It has something for everyone.  Lots of clever situation comedy embedded in this coming-of-age wilderness drama.  A few scary moments for the young ones, but nothing they can't handle.  A few sprinkles of romance.  Lots of dog-boy bonding.  The ending is predictable for all but the very young, but delightful nonetheless.  Best of all, it's just a delightful movie free of violence, car chases, shoot-outs and antagonists!  This movie was engaging from start to finish.  On par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V3A">The Journey of Natty Gann</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ZXSI">A Walk in the Clouds</a>.
