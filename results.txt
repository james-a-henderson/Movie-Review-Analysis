Some notes about the data. Invalid entries are ones where I couldn't get the program to read the data.
Useless entries are reviews where no one has rated if it was helpful or not. In both instances, the review
was ignored. However, the review still counted towards the number of entries used in training, so training
size is smaller than it may initially appear. A review was considered helpful if at least 50% of people
found it helpful (I may do some tests where 50% is considered unhelpful).

Future tests include classifying both review summary and text simuntaniously, and classifying based on
miscelanious factors of the review (length of the review, score, etc.)
